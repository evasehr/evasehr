## Hi, I am Eva. Welcome to my github world. 

Currently I am working as a scientist and bioinformatician at the AIT Austrian Institute of Technology. 
For my research interests please visit the <a href="https://www.ait.ac.at/en/research-topics/translate-to-english-bioresources/translate-to-english-improving-plant-quality"> AIT page</a>, an overview is also given on my <a href="https://evasehr.github.io"> github.io page</a>.
Although my current focus as a bioinformatician lies on data from microbe-plant interactions (e.g. transcriptomcis from the plant's side, 
and community analyses from the microbial part) I am also very much interested in machine learning in the agricultural sector. Soon more to come.

### Overview of my repositories
Briefly, I am using github for code I am currently working with and to "store" code for already analysed and published data. 
It contains

- ðŸŒ± Repos related to my bioinformatics master studies 
- ðŸŒ± A repo with the code I used for my master thesis
- ðŸŒ± Repos with code for classical community analysis of amplicon sequencing data (private)
- ðŸŒ± A repo for the development of a Shiny App for multi-omics data analysis (still private)
- ðŸŒ± A repo for classical transcriptmics analysis (private)
